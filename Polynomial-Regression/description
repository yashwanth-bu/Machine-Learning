Polynomial Regression using scikit-learn
  
Polynomial regression is an extension of simple linear regression that models the relationship between the independent variable x and the dependent variable y as an nth-degree polynomial. 
It‚Äôs used when the data points exhibit a curvilinear trend rather than a straight line, offering more flexibility compared to linear regression.

In this implementation, the polynomial regression model is built using the scikit-learn library in Python, which provides tools for data analysis and machine learning. 
Here‚Äôs a basic description of how the polynomial regression process works with the help of scikit-learn:

Data Preparation:
The input data typically consists of a single feature (independent variable x) and the corresponding target values (dependent variable y).
  
Transforming the Data:
Polynomial features are created using PolynomialFeatures from sklearn.preprocessing. This step converts the original input data into higher-degree polynomial terms. For example,
if the degree is 2, the transformed features will include ùë•**2 in addition to x.
  
Fitting the Model:
Once the features are transformed, a linear regression model is fitted to the new polynomial features using LinearRegression from sklearn.linear_model.
  
Prediction:
The model can then predict values for the dependent variable y based on new input data.
  
Visualization (Optional):
Typically, you may want to visualize the model‚Äôs fit to the data by plotting the original data points along with the polynomial regression curve.
