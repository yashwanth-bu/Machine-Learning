Linear Regression (With and Without Library)

This repo includes two implementations of Linear Regression in Python: one from scratch, demonstrating the mathematical foundation of the algorithm without any external libraries, 
and one using the sklearn library for efficient model training, prediction, and evaluation. Both approaches offer insights into how Linear Regression works.
