Python Machine Learning Algorithms (With &amp; Without Libraries)

This repository contains a collection of machine learning algorithms implemented in Python, both from scratch (without using libraries like sklearn, TensorFlow, etc.) and with the help of popular libraries. The purpose is to provide a balanced approach, where users can explore the inner workings of algorithms through scratch implementations, as well as practical, optimized implementations using established machine learning libraries.

Whether you're looking to understand the foundational principles of machine learning or you need ready-to-use implementations for practical applications, this repo offers a variety of resources for both learning and experimentation.

Feel free to explore, contribute, or suggest improvements!
