Lasso, Ridge, and Elastic Net Regression (With and Without Library)
  
This repo includes three implementations of regression models in Python: Lasso, Ridge, and Elastic Net. Each model is demonstrated both from scratch, 
showcasing the mathematical foundation of these regularized regression techniques, and using the sklearn library for efficient model training, prediction, and evaluation.

Lasso Regression (L1 Regularization): Demonstrates the implementation of Lasso regression, 
which applies L1 regularization to the linear regression model, encouraging sparse solutions by driving some of the coefficients to zero.

Ridge Regression (L2 Regularization): Implements Ridge regression, which adds L2 regularization to the model, 
preventing overfitting by shrinking the coefficients, but unlike Lasso, it does not set any coefficients exactly to zero.

Elastic Net Regression: Combines both L1 and L2 regularization, incorporating both Lasso and Ridge techniques.
This method is useful when there are multiple features correlated with each other.

The repo offers insights into the underlying math of these models and how they can be implemented efficiently with libraries like sklearn, 
providing a practical comparison between custom implementation and optimized library usage.
